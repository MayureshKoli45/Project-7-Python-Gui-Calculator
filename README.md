# Python-Gui-Calculator-

Making a Calculator in Python using Tkinter and adding a Gui to the Calculator.

To make this calculator i have used object oriented programming approch.

In this repositary I am adding the python code and some additional image and icon files which are used to make this calculator.

Important Note :- While running this program make sure that the code file, icon and image which is used should be in the same folder.

After writing the code you can convert .py file to .exe file but make sure that .exe file, icon and image shoul be in same folder.
